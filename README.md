# 🚀 CodeGotLatent – Where Code Meets Competition

***A parody of India's Got Talent – but for coders!***

Welcome to **CodeGotLatent**, a competitive programming platform that merges *skill*, *intuition*, and *fun*. Contestants solve curated coding challenges and then **guess their rank** based on performance. If the guess is close, their **rating spikes**. If not... better luck next time!
